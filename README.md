# Note-taker

## Description 
This is my note taking app. This is deployed to a server so anyone with the link can update this note taking app.

## Installation
The tools that I used for this application is Express.js. The steps that I took towards making this are as followed, 
first I had to require all of the required mudules fs, express, path etc. The next step was setting up the server with the correct middle wear. Next was the tricky part for me, this application requiered my to provide a link that no matter the url led to the landing page. My next step was to provide a post and a get route 
```
'/api/notes'
```
both of these routes have a readFile and the post route has the additions of parsing out data along.
